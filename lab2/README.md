## Questions

1. What is an API?

- It allows for systems to interact with existing services without the need to rebuild them for their own use.

2. What is a RESTful API?

- It is a style used for making networking applications. One can use various HTTP methods to utilize online resources such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
- Were the APIs we used RESTful?
  -- Yes, they were. We used a couple of GET requests from select URL endpoints to get the data we needed.

3. What is JSON?

- JSON is a style of object notation for JavaScript; however, it can be utilized by any language that can access REST APIs. It provides data in string format so it can be easily consumed by programs to use the data further.
- Did these APIs use JSON?
  -- These APIs provided us with JSON in response to the GET requests.

4. What is Bash?

- Bash processes commands from the command line and can also process these commands through a script file.
- Have you ever used Bash?
  -- Yes, even though the syntax can be annoying at times.
